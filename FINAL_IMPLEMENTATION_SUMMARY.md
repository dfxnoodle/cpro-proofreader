# CPRO Writing Style Guide Checker - Final Implementation Summary

## 🎉 **COMPLETE**: Clean Citations Implementation

The CPRO Writing Style Guide Checker now has a **clean, simplified** citation system where style guide references are embedded directly within each mistake description.

## ✅ **Final Implementation**

### **How Citations Work Now**
- **No separate citations section** - cleaner UI
- **Citations embedded in mistakes** - each issue shows its source directly
- **Example output**:
  ```
  Issues Identified:
  1. Changed 'have' to 'has' to agree with the singular subject 'document'. 
     (CUHK English Style Guide, Section 2.1: Subject-Verb Agreement)
  
  2. Changed 'grammar mistakes' to 'grammatical mistakes' for correct adjective usage. 
     (CUHK English Style Guide, Section 2.2: Word Forms)
  ```

### **Backend Changes**
- **Assistant Instructions**: Updated to embed citations directly in mistake descriptions
- **JSON Structure**: Simplified - citations are part of each mistake text
- **Clean Response**: No need for separate citation processing

### **Frontend Changes**
- **Removed**: `displayCitations()` and `displayDocxCitations()` functions
- **Simplified**: No dynamic citation box creation
- **Cleaner**: Just display mistakes with embedded citations

## 🎨 **User Experience**
