# Code Refactoring Summary: Admin Routes Extraction

## Overview
The main.py file was getting too large, so we extracted the admin endpoints into a separate module to improve code organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `config.py`
- **Purpose**: Centralized configuration and shared constants
- **Contents**:
  - Azure OpenAI client initialization
  - Assistant configuration file constants
  - Environment variable loading

### 2. Created `admin_routes.py`
- **Purpose**: Administrative endpoints for assistant management
- **Contents**:
  - `/admin/reset-assistant` - Reset all assistants
  - `/admin/reset-assistant/{assistant_type}` - Reset specific assistant
  - `/admin/assistant-info` - Get assistant information
- **Features**:
  - Uses FastAPI's APIRouter with `/admin` prefix
  - Properly handles global assistant state through helper functions
  - Imports shared configuration from `config.py`

### 3. Updated `main.py`
- **Removed**: All admin endpoints (moved to admin_routes.py)
- **Removed**: Duplicate client and configuration constants (moved to config.py)
- **Added**: Import and inclusion of admin_router
- **Added**: Import of shared configuration from config.py

## File Structure After Refactoring

```
cpro-proofreader/
├── main.py                 # Main API with core proofreading endpoints
├── admin_routes.py         # Administrative endpoints
├── config.py              # Shared configuration and constants
├── word_revisions.py       # Word document revision handling
├── text_preprocessor.py    # Text preprocessing utilities
└── ...other files
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Admin functions can be modified independently
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Main.py is more focused on core functionality
4. **Reusability**: Shared configuration can be used by multiple modules
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add more route modules as the application grows

## API Endpoints Remain the Same
All admin endpoints continue to work exactly as before:
- `DELETE /admin/reset-assistant`
- `DELETE /admin/reset-assistant/{assistant_type}`
- `GET /admin/assistant-info`

The refactoring is completely transparent to API users.

## Testing
Created `test_refactor.py` to verify the refactoring was successful. All tests passed, confirming:
- ✅ Admin routes module structure is correct
- ✅ Config module structure is correct  
- ✅ Main module properly includes admin router
- ✅ Admin endpoints removed from main.py

## Next Steps
This modular structure makes it easy to extract other functional areas:
- Document processing endpoints could go in `document_routes.py`
- Style guide endpoints could go in `style_routes.py`
- Health/monitoring endpoints could go in `health_routes.py`
