Muslims are Arabs or Turkish. Whenever possible, express the spel ling and cultural nuances of 
an individual’s given and family names accurately. 
 Aboriginal and Indigenous should always be capitalised. Where possible, aim to use a person’s

 a poorly performed act 
 a scientifically proven theory 
 
Use hyphens for short and common adverbs 
 a well -taken point 
 a much -admired speech 
 Note the following distinctions between hyphens and dashes 
 Use a hyphen to join compound words, as in “a high- level committee”, “his father - in-
law”, and to divide words at the end of a line 
 Use a dash to indicate a range or a continnum, as in “… accounts for 20–25% …”, “the 
school year 2007–08” 
 Use a hyphen to join the two parts of a double -barreled name of a person: Lloyd - Jones

authors/creators/performers: Lennon–McCartney compositions, the Yang–Mill theory 
 Use a dash to join coordinate and contrasting pairs: a current –voltage graph, the height –
depth ratio 
 A dash can also add a touch of drama, such as marking a sudden break in a sentence, or to add emphasis or an aside. But use sparingly. 
e.g. The triennium – which means a period of three years – is almost over. 
e.g. Professor Chan is also fascinated by the organic matter trapped within Antarctic ice – which might seem surprising, given that he is best known for his work in palaeontology.

pronouns (gender -neutral)

---

### Chunk 32
## A gender -neutral pronoun is one that refers to an antecedent the gender of which is not specified.

---

### Chunk 33
- It is the pronoun for baby and child as long as the gender of the young one concerned cannot 
be determined. 
- One is also a gender -neutral pronoun. Its genitive form is one ’s and its reflexive is 
oneself. 
- Gender neutrality is also achieved by using he or she as in: The ideal candidate is a fresh 
graduate. He or she must demonstrate a willingness to learn. 
 
Other acceptable variants are him or her , his or her and himself or herself . These must, however, 
be used sparingly. 
- Some writers use a pronoun in the third person plural ( they, them , and then the highly 
irregular themself). Such usage is time -honoured and appears in the Shakespeare canon, 
but it nevertheless creates an agreement problem with the verb to follow and causes 
confusion, and therefore should be avoided. 
 
Some writers prefer to use he and she alternately when the antecedent is generic and of 
unspecified gender. This creates confusion as the reader may be misled to think that more than 
one individual is involved. 
- The forms s/he , he/she , his/her and him/herself are artificial and should be avoided.

---

### Chunk 34
## Q 
 
quotation marks 
 
Use double quotation marks (“…”) for a quote or a quoted speech, except for a quote within a 
quote, a headline, or a title within a quote —in which case, use the single quotation marks. 
- Life permeated Virginia Woolf’s work, as she drew on childhood memories, her family, and intense “moments of being”. 
- “She would quote this line as she signed her new book for her fans, especially young people: ‘It’s not the dog in the fight, but the fight in the dog,’” Pang told me. 
- (in a title/headline) NFTs double down on the weirdness by going ‘phygital’ 
- Spencer says: “And here is ‘Jerusalem’, Blake’s visionary anthem to his homeland, 
blaring from our screens every time the England football team take to the turf.” 
 
The general rule is that periods and commas should be placed inside the closing quotation mark, 
regardless of whether they are part of the quote or not. 
- The principal was heard to have said: “The board has approved the extra funding in the next school year.” 
- When John F. Kennedy said: “Ask what you can do for your country,” he’s appealing for greater civic participation of the American people. 
 
If the quote is a term, a short phrase or saying with no introductory punctuation, the period or 
comma should be placed outside the closing quotation mark. 
- Civilians killed in the cross -fires between warring factions are considered “collateral 
damage”. 
- With the saying “If there is a will there is a way”, the guest of honour began his keynote speech to the congregation.” 
 
quotes 
Avoid duplicating a narrative in quotes. The quote should support or supplement the main 
narrative, or vice versa. 
 
Go for paraphrasing or building a supporting narrative with quotes, instead of having long 
sentences or block quotes.

---

### Chunk 35
## R 
 
respective 
 
The nouns following and qualified by respective take plural forms. 
 All Department Chairmen / School Directors / Unit Heads should ensure that effective
